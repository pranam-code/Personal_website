                    <h4>My First Project after 5 years of gap.</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>2 months after writing my first Hello World program on March 8th 2019(While revising all my concepts
                    that i learned in my Masters) After I enjoyed my motherhood for 5 years with my two kids(4 and 6
                    yrs old) I had started learning to take a stab at building a better future for myself.</p>
                <p>I made my first project RESUME PARSER related to ATS(Application Tracking System) which is the main hurdle that I
                started facing when I applied for jobs.</p>
                <p>From this you'll see that I'm someone that started her journey learning in this advance world of Technology.</p>

                    <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece.I break the code
                    where I need to figure out why things work the way they do and I test my Projects using Selenium and build Frameworks for them using POM.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>After almost 4 months of self study day and night to recall all concepts in my Masters I'm ready to learn something new.
                    I am keep making new websites to enhance my skills and to take my learning curve more steeper.
                    Apart from building small projects I would love to enter a position where I can be a part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
